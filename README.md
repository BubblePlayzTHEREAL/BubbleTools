# About
---

Here are some little tools I have come up with. I dont have much right now but you could add an "issue" on the github or email me and suggest a tool or inclusion I could try to add.
# Tools
## linebreak
Creates an empty line in the console/terminal
### Usage
`bubltools.linebreak(lines)`

lines is the amount of lines to get rid of (default is 1)
